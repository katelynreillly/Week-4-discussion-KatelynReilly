  <h1>Hi, I’m Katelyn</h1>

  <p>
    I’m a student interested in marketing, technology, and creative design.
    I enjoy working on projects that combine visuals with strategy.
  </p>

  <p>
    This website is inspired by Pinterest-style layouts and focuses on
    showcasing ideas in a visual, scroll-friendly way.
  </p>

  <p>
    In the future, I plan to use this site as a place to share projects,
    inspiration, and personal interests.
